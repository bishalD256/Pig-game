# Pig-game
It is a web based game developed with the help of **html-CSS-JavaScript**. I have used **DOM manipulation** to developed the game. 

There is 2 player, players need to roll the dice.
The Player1 will get the first chance to roll the dice

After clicking the **ROLL DICE** button, the random generated number will come between 1 and 6. If the value is between 2 and 6 then, that score will added to **CURRENT** score and active player will get a chance again untill he gets a value 1. If the value comes between 2 and 6, then the active player will get a 2 options.

1. Player can roll the dice again
2. Player can click the **HOLD** button to add the value to his score and the second player will get a chnce.

After clicking **HOLD** button, the current score got added to Player1's score and Player2 get the chance to roll the dice

If the dice value is 1, then active player will lose the CURRENT score and nothing will added to that player's score and second player will get the chance to roll the dice.


The first one to score 100 will win
